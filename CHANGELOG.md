# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Ephemeral Tor/Proxychains lifecycle script (`plugins/proteus/scripts/tor-ephemeral.sh`)
  with seven commands: bootstrap, start, check, enforce, relax, stop, purge.
- Network Operations section in the base research contract requiring all outbound
  traffic through `proxychains4` and prohibiting host-level `webfetch` usage.
- Iptables kernel-level enforcement mode (`enforce`/`relax`) that DROP all non-Tor
  outbound TCP, blocking even host-level HTTP clients.
- Operational Hygiene section in the base research contract mandating active
  trace cleanup (8-step scrub checklist) before every agent return or handoff.
- Per-agent scrub instructions for Artificer, Chaos, Mimic, Cicada, Atlas, and
  Libris covering temp files, build artifacts, Docker images, proxy captures,
  and environment variables.
- Network routing and post-operation scrub directives in web-intel, web-research,
  and mobile-reversing skills.
- Tor/Proxychains and hygiene sections in OpenCode `/proteus` command template
  and Claude Code `commands/proteus.md`.
- Research artifact anti-leak patterns in `.gitignore` covering findings,
  reports, proxy captures, credentials, shell history, and extracted artifacts.

### Changed

- Network routing now uses `proxychains4` exclusively; `ALL_PROXY` env var
  export was removed from the bootstrap flow because it conflicts with
  proxychains and causes connection failures.
- Install/cleanup robustness: `install_tor` now reports failures correctly,
  `nohup` added for shell-independent process lifetime, `stop_ephemeral` kills
  orphaned processes and cleans stale data directories.
- Proxychains config fixed from `socks4` to `socks5` for remote DNS support.

### Fixed

- `tor-*` gitignore pattern that accidentally excluded `tor-ephemeral.sh` script;
  replaced with specific patterns (`tor-data/`, `tor-ephemeral/`, `torrc.local`).
- Tor process dying when bash shell ended (missing `nohup` in start flow).
- `install_tor` returning success when package installation failed silently.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Campaign-scoped research state with create, resume, checkpoint, close, digest, events, and entity links.
- Hypothesis branches for explicit creative attack paths, ROI scoring, preconditions, success criteria, kill conditions, and branch status.
- Structured campaign checkpoints with confirmed, killed, open, pivots, score changes, context compression, next high-ROI move, and contract signature fields.
- MCP response envelopes with advisories, related records, suggested reads, and state deltas.
- Deterministic similarity query that separates duplicate/report coverage from broader memory matches.
- Auto-linking from the single active campaign to newly recorded hypotheses, evidence, decisions, validation gates, and specialist outputs.
- Database-level Proteus version metadata so automatic migrations run only when the stored base version is missing or differs from the runtime version.
- Modular Proteus skills for chaining, fuzzing, codebase research, web intel, web research, PoC/exploit work, and checkpoints.
- Expanded individual skill contracts with professional heuristics for non-obvious chaining, calibrated fuzzing, active codebase learning, realistic PoCs, and intelligence-driven pivots.
- Strengthened report-writing guidance to follow supplied templates, avoid artificial checklist/legalistic prose, and write concise triage-ready summaries for readers with no prior context.
- Added report anti-pattern guardrails for common LLM phrasing, defensive caveats, Impact-section reframing, verbose reproduction steps, local workspace leakage, and adjustment replies that are not written for an external triager.
- Cicada specialist role for advanced exploit development, bypass work, and chaining on already-promising targets.
- Shared base research contract requiring realistic exploitability, anti-slop validation, dedupe, public-known checks, and explicit contract attestation.
- GitHub Actions CI and tag-based release automation for `v*` tags.

### Changed

- Strengthened coordinator and specialist prompts around Tree-of-Thoughts style branching, ROI ranking, validation gates, reflection checkpoints, and evidence-backed decisions.
- Updated README and architecture docs to explain plugin, CLI, MCP runtime, campaigns, branches, checkpoints, and release behavior.
- Expanded CLI and MCP smoke coverage to exercise campaigns, branches, checkpoints, links, similarity, migration, and MCP state recovery.
- Updated release automation so GitHub Release notes are copied from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` version section, and merges to `main` create the version tag/release when the tag is missing.
- Clarified that Codex users should invoke the plugin with `@proteus`, while `/proteus` is the Claude Code slash command.
- Made checkpoint contract-signature parsing friendlier to Windows shells by accepting comma-separated `key=value` pairs in addition to JSON.
- Changed release-note generation so a missing changelog section for a new version reuses the latest version notes instead of falling back to commit summaries.

### Migration

- Added transactional, idempotent schema migrations with recorded migration versions.
- Added `proteus_metadata` with `proteus_version` tracking for migration gating and status reporting.
- Existing `.vros/memory.sqlite` databases are migrated automatically when opened by the new runtime.
- Added explicit `proteus migrate --root <target>` and migration status reporting.

### Deferred

- Chimera/Claude hybrid mode remains intentionally deferred to a later update.
